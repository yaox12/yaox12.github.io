about-me:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Currently I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Lifeng Sun.
      I received my bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in 2016.

      My research interests focus on the federated learning, lifelong/continual learning and domain adaptation.
